# Задание 2 / 8 kyu:

I'm new to coding and now I want to get the ```sum of two arrays```... Actually the ``sum of all their elements``. I'll appreciate for your help.

P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

Example:

```
arrayPlusArray([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]); //21
```
